        <p>Here I will highlight some of systems I developed during this project.</p>
        
        <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/EnemyJumpPortfolio.gif"/></p>

        <p>We didn't want every enemy to move the same way, so we decided to make two types of enemy movement. Jumping enemies can jump over obstacles in front of them and can get on top of tables in order to reach the player. They can also jump over the player's projectiles.</p>

        <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/FishGif.gif"/></p>

        <p>The Fish Burger enemy slides across the ground. It is much faster than than the jumping enemies. When they get into attack range they will attempt to bite the player.</p>

        <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/SpawnPortfolio.gif"></p>

        <p>The spawning system gets all the spawners in the level and will spawn an enemy at a random spawner every few seconds. It constantlty checks if all enemies are dead and will start the countdown to the next wave if true. A data table is used to create the waves. </p>
